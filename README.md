# Sink-the-ships

## Setup :
- I made this project using Intellij Community Edition.
- You can start by creating an empty Java project without including any frameworks.
- Use a JDK that supports Swing GUI-library. For this project I used JDK 14.0.2 

Once you are done with all the points above, simply use the "src" folder and add it to your project.


## About the game :
You start the game by choosing 1 of two maps by using Intellij's terminal. You are always controlling one player and your mission is to find and sink all the five ships on the gameplan. 


## What is used in this project :
- MVC pattern
- Swing (for GUI)
- Interface 
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Hierarchy
